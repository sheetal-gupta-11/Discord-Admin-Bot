What Is Discord?
Discord is a voice and text communication platform for gamers.
Players, streamers, and developers use Discord to discuss games, answer questions, chat while they play, and much more. It even has a game store, complete with critical reviews and a subscription service. It is nearly a one-stop shop for gaming communities.
While there are many things you can build using Discord’s APIs, this tutorial will focus on a particular learning outcome: how to make a Discord bot in Python.

What Is a Bot?
Discord is growing in popularity. As such, automated processes, such as banning inappropriate users and reacting to user requests are vital for a community to thrive and grow.
Automated programs that look and act like users and automatically respond to events and commands on Discord are called bot users. Discord bot users (or just bots) have nearly unlimited applications.

For example, let’s say you’re managing a new Discord guild and a user joins for the very first time. Excited, you may personally reach out to that user and welcome them to your community. You might also tell them about your channels or ask them to introduce themselves.
The user feels welcomed and enjoys the discussions that happen in your guild and they, in turn, invite friends.
Over time, your community grows so big that it’s no longer feasible to personally reach out to each new member, but you still want to send them something to recognize them as a new member of the guild.

With a bot, it’s possible to automatically react to the new member joining your guild. You can even customize its behavior based on context and control how it interacts with each new user.
